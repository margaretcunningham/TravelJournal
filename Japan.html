                I visited Kentucky this year with my <br>
                family. It was so beautiful and I can't <br>
                wait to come back. We went camping and <br>
                saw the Mammoth Caves. We also visited <br>
                the University of Kentucky. Go Cats! <br>
                We saw a Kentucky basketball game in <br>
                Rupp Arena and loved the atmosphere. <br>
