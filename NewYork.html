                I visited New York this summer and loved <br>
                every part of it! It is home to millions <br>
                of people and has amazing nightlife. <br>
                Central Park was my favorite part because <br>
                it is a relaxing getaway in the middle of <br>
                a bustling city. I also visited Times Square <br>
		        and saw all of the lights at night.<br>
