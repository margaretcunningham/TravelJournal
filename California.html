                Third time visiting has by far been <br>
                my favorite. California, you're going <br>
                to gain a new resitent soon. The poeple have <br>
                been so kind. This is time we really made <br>
                it a point to go to the local spots in <br>
                San Diego to the local spots in San Diego to <br>
                really get a feel for the state. <br> 
                And the locals are the chillest people ever. <br>
                <br> 
                In conclusion, I love california SO MUCH <br>
