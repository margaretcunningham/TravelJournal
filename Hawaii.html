                Hawaii is my favorite place that I have <br>
                ever visited. It has beaches with sand <br>
                of all different colors, including <br>
                white, red and black. It is home of the <br>
                most unique flora and fauna and many <br>
                kind people. It is made up of islands, <br>
                each with a unique beauty. <br>
