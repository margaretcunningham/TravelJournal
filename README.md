Description of Project:
This project was created for Technica 2022. It is a web application that allows the user to document
their travel history. Information is already hardcodied into it as of now. There is a drop-down menu of locations
that have already been visited and a menu for bookmarked pages. When the user clicks on the a specific location reel, then the journal entry pops up with all the information including ranking, cities visited, a picture, etc... For places that are bookmarked,
a page pops up with an image that says you have yet to travel here. The user can click their profile icon and see their account information. The saved reels pops a page with saved reels. The create a new reel pops up a form for the user to enter new information to create a new reel (This part is not finished.) Finally, on the home page their is a small U.S. map, which pops up a page with an Interactive United States map that is color coded based on the key of whether the user has visited it, bookmarked it, or has not visited it. 

Future Work:
*No longer hard code the journal entries. Instead get all the information from the user.
*Be able to submit the create new reels information to actually create a new reel and journal entry
*Expand the application to be allow the user to input locations outside the United States
