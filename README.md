# TravelJournal
Authors: Tiffany Clark, Sydney Schenk, Margaret Cunningham, Emily Behrendsen


Description of Project:
This project was created for Technica 2022. It is a web application that allows the user to document
their travel history. There is a drop-down menu of locations the user has already visited and a menu for bookmarked pages. When the user clicks on the a specific location reel, then the journal entry opens up with all the information including ranking, cities visited, a picture, etc... For places that are bookmarked, a page opens up with an image that says you have yet to travel here. The user can click their profile icon and see their account information.
The saved reels button opens a page with saved reels. The create a new reel opens a form for the user to enter new information to create a new reel. Finally, on the home page there is a small U.S. map, which opens a page with an Interactive United States map that 
is color coded based on the key of whether the user has visited it, bookmarked it, or has not visited it. This map came from open source software with permissions given to modify the code. This project modifies the origial map by changing the colors and labels of the states based on visit status.

Future Work:
*No longer hard code the journal entries. Instead get all the information from the user.
*Be able to submit the create new reels information to actually create a new reel and journal entry
*Expand the application to be allow the user to input locations outside the United States
